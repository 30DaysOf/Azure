# Azure - In #30Days (More or Less)

The [#30Days](https://github.com/30DaysOf/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md) series of projects began as a way to create _structured roadmaps_ to help beginners and experienced developers alike navigate the broad concepts-to-code-to-cloud journey for a given technology.

After a full year of projects, it has now evolved into a platform I use for self-guided learning at the granularity of individual articles, or composed into longer journeys (7-day sprints, 30-day roadmaps).

This project aims to bring that #30Days process and platform to the exploration of [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) with an initial focus on _application development_.

#Let's Go!

## Learning Objectives

While learning organically is always encouraged, it helps to set a learning goal that influences the topics and timeline you prioritize for each sprint (week) or roadmap (month or longer). Picking a certification as a target can not only help keep you focused, it can give you a meaningful credential for your professional profile. Here are a few beginner-friendly Microsoft certifications to choose from.

 - [AZ-900](https://learn.microsoft.com/certifications/azure-fundamentals/) - Azure Fundamentals
 - [DP-900](https://learn.microsoft.com/certifications/azure-data-fundamentals/) - Azure Data Fundamentals
 - [AI-900](https://learn.microsoft.com/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/) - Azure AI Fundamentals
 - [SC-900](https://learn.microsoft.com/certifications/security-compliance-and-identity-fundamentals/) - Security, Compliance & Identity Fundamentals
 - [PL-900](https://learn.microsoft.com/certifications/power-platform-fundamentals/) - Power Platform Fundamentals
 - [MS-900](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/microsoft-365-fundamentals/) - M365 Fundamentals

## Learning Platform

All my recent #30Days projects have been built on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) - a static site generation platform that supports both Markdown and MDX (JSX-flavored Markdown) allowing us to enhance text-based content formats with interactive React components.

There are more optimal (lightweight, performant) options to pick from, but for now I am going with familiarity so I can focus on content. Want to learn more about the setup and usage? Check out  the [website/README.md](website/README.md) for more details.
